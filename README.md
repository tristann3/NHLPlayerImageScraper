This is Part 1 to my walkthrough on NHL Player Team Prediction task. You can find Part 2 in this [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/tristanthompson2/nhl-player-image-classification)


## How to run 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tristann3/NHLPlayerImageScraper.git
pip install requirements.txt
python3 image_scraper.py
```

This will clone the repo to your machine, install dependencies, and run the image scraper to save images locally to your machine. Read the comments in the image_scraper.py file to see how it works!
